# Software needed for workshop

##Anaconda for Python 3.7
https://www.anaconda.com/download/

## Setup instructions (Please follow)
Open up the anaconda prompt (you can type anaconda prompt in your OS's search bar and it should be one of the first options):

Then, in the prompt you will want to write
```
conda install tensorflow
```

then
```
conda install numpy
```

and finally
```
conda install pillow
```

If you are using a different package manager or don't require one, then using 
```
pip install
```

rather than
```
conda install
```

should be fine
